Coursework for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

Course Project

(find all project-related materials in the UCI HAR Dataset directory, however, copies of the important files have been put into this main directory to fulfill the submission requirement)

    Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\

    Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\UCI HAR Dataset\

    In RStudio: setwd("C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\R\\UCI HAR Dataset\\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

    Use data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows. Note that the provided R script has no assumptions on numbers of records, only on locations of files.


Data Description

Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
